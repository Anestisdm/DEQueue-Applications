# Double Ended Queue

### 1 - Scope
The purpose of this project is to implement a basic abstract data type such as Double Ended Queue so that it can be used in two applications

### 2 - Application *Postfix to Infix*
The application will read an arithmetic expression in Postfix format and will print the corresponding Infix format. For simplicity, we will consider that arithmetic expressions contain single digits integers and use the operators +, -, *, /. Also validation is performed and an error message is displayed in case the input expression is not in a valid Postfix format.

### 3 - Application *DNA Palindrome*
The Application reads a sequence of characters representing DNA sequence and decides if it is a Watson-Crick complemented palindrome. The application also performs a validation check of the inserted DNA sequence (e.g. does not contain spaces or unacceptable characters, non-capital letters), and in finally print the relevant result.

##### Explanation
*A DNA sequence is an alpharethmetic representation, consisting of the letters A, T, C, G. These letters correspond to the nucleotides Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine, Guanine. Nucleotides A and T are complementary to each other and we will say that A is complement of T and vice versa. Similarly C is the complement of G and G is the complement of C. A DNA sequence is a Watson-Crick complemented palindrome if, when we replace each nucleotide with the complement it and then reverse the order, then we get the same sequence as the original. For example the string AAAACGTTTT is complementary palindrome. On the contrary, ATAATA is not.*
